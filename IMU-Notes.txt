        /* Define how the hub is mounted to the robot to get the correct Yaw, Pitch and Roll values.
         *
         * You can apply up to three axis rotations to orient your Hub according to how it's mounted on the robot.
         *
         * The starting point for these rotations is the "Default" Hub orientation, which is:
         * 1) Hub laying flat on a horizontal surface, with the Printed Logo facing UP
         * 2) Rotated such that the USB ports are facing forward on the robot.
         *
         * The order that the rotations are performed matters, so this sample shows doing them in the order X, Y, then Z.
         * For specifying non-orthogonal hub mounting orientations, we must temporarily use axes
         * defined relative to the Hub itself, instead of the usual Robot Coordinate System axes
         * used for the results the IMU gives us. In the starting orientation, the Hub axes are
         * aligned with the Robot Coordinate System:
         *
         * X Axis:  Starting at Center of Hub, pointing out towards I2C connectors
         * Y Axis:  Starting at Center of Hub, pointing out towards USB connectors
         * Z Axis:  Starting at Center of Hub, pointing Up through LOGO
         *
         * Positive rotation is defined by right-hand rule with thumb pointing in +ve direction on axis.
         *
         * Some examples.
         *
         * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         * Example A) Assume that the hub is mounted on a sloped plate at the back of the robot, with the USB ports coming out the top of the hub.
         *  The plate is tilted UP 60 degrees from horizontal.
         *
         *  To get the "Default" hub into this configuration you would just need a single rotation.
         *  1) Rotate the Hub +60 degrees around the X axis to tilt up the front edge.
         *  2) No rotation around the Y or Z axes.
         *
         *  So the X,Y,Z rotations would be 60,0,0
         *
         * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         * Example B) Assume that the hub is laying flat on the chassis, but it has been twisted 30 degrees towards the right front wheel to make
         *  the USB cable accessible.
         *
         *  To get the "Default" hub into this configuration you would just need a single rotation, but around a different axis.
         *  1) No rotation around the X or Y axes.
         *  1) Rotate the Hub -30 degrees (Clockwise) around the Z axis, since a positive angle would be Counter Clockwise.
         *
         *  So the X,Y,Z rotations would be 0,0,-30
         *
         * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         *  Example C) Assume that the hub is mounted on a vertical plate on the right side of the robot, with the Logo facing out, and the
         *  Hub rotated so that the USB ports are facing down 30 degrees towards the back wheels of the robot.
         *
         *  To get the "Default" hub into this configuration will require several rotations.
         *  1) Rotate the hub +90 degrees around the X axis to get it standing upright with the logo pointing backwards on the robot
         *  2) Next, rotate the hub +90 around the Y axis to get it facing to the right.
         *  3) Finally rotate the hub +120 degrees around the Z axis to take the USB ports from vertical to sloping down 30 degrees and
         *     facing towards the back of the robot.
         *
         *  So the X,Y,Z rotations would be 90,90,120
